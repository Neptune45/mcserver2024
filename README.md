# Overview
Follow the below steps to configure your Minecraft to work with the Borderbands server

# Prerequisites
- [JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [CurseForge (Standalone)](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app#download-options)
    - Can go with [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html) as well. Setting that up is similar but will not be outlined in this doc.

# Setting Up the ModPack
1. Minecraft should already populate in the left navigation bar. If not click: \
"+" > Scan Computer for games > Select Drive Minecraft is on > Scan
2. Click into Minecraft, then click "+ Create". Minecraft version is 1.20.1, Game Type is Forge, and leave the modloader version at default
3. While in your new modpack, hit the hotdog menu next to the "Play" button, then select "Open Folder". A File Explorer window should then show up.
4. [Download the mods folder in the repo.](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNeptune45%2Fmcserver2024%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fmods) This website takes everything from the "mods" folder on the repo, compresses, and downloads it
5. Extract all the contents of the .zip file into the "mods" folder that should have shown in Step 3. There should be 260 mods shown in CurseForge once this is done
6. Go to the Hotdog menu, then uncheck "Use System Memory Settings". It's recommended to use at least 8GB (8192 MB) for a guaranteed smooth experience on a modded client. If your computer is short on RAM, make sure at least 4GB (4096 MB) is allocated for a playable experience.
7. Hit Play and a Forge version of Minecraft should open up. It's expected for your client to stop responding multiple times while loading, so don't worry if it looks like it's crashing.
8. Ask the server host for the IP to connect to
